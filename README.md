# PyPartitioner
A simple disk partitioner that uses libparted-dev

This program was not intended for well versed python programmers, it is instead intended for those new to python or those who have no prior experience at all what so ever.

Priorities for the growth of this program will be in the following order:
  1. Create the basic tools needed for manipulating disks, building off of parted, and making it easier to use.
     This is not too complicated as the parted library already offers a wide variety of tools for us.
     
     Such priorities are aimed at non-programmers who would be using the tool.
     
  2. Create C or C++ extensions to build off of what libparted-dev has to offer.
     This would include adding code to both the GNU libparted-dev library, as well as this file.
     
     Such priorities are aimed to experienced developers.     

This is not complete by any means. All suggestions related to the security and stability of this program are welcome if including technical detail.
